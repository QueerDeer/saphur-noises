From childhood's hour.. i haven't been..
As others were. I have not seen
As others saw. I could not bring
My passions.. from a common spring..
From the same source i haven't taken
My sorrow. I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone..
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then in my childhood, in the dawn..
Of a most stormy life. was drawn..
From every depth of good and ill..
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountaen,
From the red cliff of the mountaen,
From the sun that roundme rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven's blue)
Of. A Demon. In my view!
